## Day 3: Wireframes & Styling

- **Wireframes**:  
  Saved in the `design/` folder:
  - `wireframes.png` – Home screen layout, Detail screen layout, and Add Item screen layout

- **Styling Approach**:  
  We’ll use **React Native Paper** for Material-style UI components (Cards, Buttons, FABs) and its theming system for consistent colors and spacing.

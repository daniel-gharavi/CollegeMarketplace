## Day 3: Wireframes & Styling

- **Wireframes**:  
  Saved in the `design/` folder:
  - `wireframes.png` – Home screen layout, Detail screen layout, and Add Item screen layout

- **Styling Approach**:  
  We’ll use **React Native Paper** for Material-style UI components (Cards, Buttons, FABs) and its theming system for consistent colors and spacing.

## Day 4: Home Screen UI

- **Installed:**  
  - `react-native-paper`  
  - `@expo/vector-icons`  
  - `expo-image-picker`  
- **Features implemented:**  
  - Material **Searchbar**  
  - Two-column **Card** grid showing item titles and prices  
  - Floating **FAB** to navigate to the Add Item screen
